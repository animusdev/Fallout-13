## Terms of service

A friendly reminder to anyone who would like to create personal edition of a game to host a server while keeping the code base private - a source code is licensed under /tg/ Station 13 terms, and thus rendering your project closed-source will likely cause considerable sanctions on their behalf. Honestly, we tried it ourselves - it didn't work, and Byond administration officially disabled one of our servers for violation of licensing terms - don't repeat our mistakes.

**Please carefully read the following statement:**

If you desire to host your own server based of Fallout 13 source code - you may not pretend to be an "Official Fallout 13" community.

*The only Fallout 13 communities that are considered official at the moment are specified as:*

1. [EN] Fallout 13 - Vault One
2. [RU] Fallout 13 - CBET ATOMA ( Light of the Atom )

**By our terms and conditions we require any potential host to specify that they are an unofficial server in announcements and the Byond HUB.**

Stated terms of service fully comply with the original AGPL v3 license of /tg/ Station 13, as long as this applies to the running server of unofficial community.
