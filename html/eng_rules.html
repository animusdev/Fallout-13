<h2>Rules:</h2><br>
<i>0) Don't be a dick (Memes IC and stupid behavior)</i><br>
<i>1) Metagame. (For example, just respawned guy remembers his previous life.)</i><br>
<i>2) Respawn without name change. (Also better to change your appearance.)</i><br>
<i>3) Meta revenge for your death.</i><br>
<i>4) No OOC in IC, IC in OOC too.</i><br>
<i>5) Don't attack without reason.</i><br>
<i><h3>Additional rules for vault residents:</h3><i><br>
<i>1) Don't leave the vault for no reason.</i><br>
<i>2) Ghouls are misfits. If one of them will appear in your vault, nobody will be against to murder it or exile.</i><br>
<i>3) Overseer - local authority. If he decided to kick someone's ass and take it's sweet roll, his people must go there, kick someone's ass and bring sweet roll to overseer.</i><br>
